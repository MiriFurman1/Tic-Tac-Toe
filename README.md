<h1>Tic Tac Toe Game in React</h1>
<p>This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using React. The game allows two players to play against each other on a 3x3 board with a fun twist - the "X" symbol is represented by a cat and the "O" symbol is represented by a dog!</p>
<h2>Demo</h2>
<p>You can play the game without installing anything by visiting the <a href="https://tic-tac-toe-miri.netlify.app/">live demo</a>.</p>
<h2>How to Play</h2>
<ol>
    <li>The game will automatically assign the "cat" symbol to the first player and the "dog" symbol to the second player.</li>
    <li>Players take turns clicking on the cells of the board to place their symbols.</li>
    <li>The first player to get three symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.</li>
    <li>If there are no more moves left and neither player has won, the game ends in a tie.</li>
     <li>The number of wins for each player is counted and displayed on the screen.</li>
    <li>Clicking "restart" starts a new game, but the number of wins for each player is saved.</li>
</ol>
